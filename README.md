java-script-template
====================

So there are lots of great scripting languages out there that offer a lot over plain old shell scripting. If you know java
then groovy is very close and a good option but there is the alternative to write pure java by embedding it into a bash script
 like [template.sh](https://github.com/davidmoten/java-script-template/blob/master/template.sh).

The script is designed for linux with a bash shell.
